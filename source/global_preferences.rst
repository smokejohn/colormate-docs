Colorscheme Color Harmony calculation
#####################################

Standard Hue:
    Strictly mathematical calculation of the four Color Harmony Groups. (Example: complementary color is exactly on the opposite of the color wheel 180 deg)

Mapped Hue (Adobe-Kuler-ish): 
    Perceptive calculation of the four Color Harmony Groups. Depending on the hue of the color the calculated color harmonies are shifted towards more pleasing colors. This is close to what Adobe online color harmony tool does to get nicer color harmonies.
