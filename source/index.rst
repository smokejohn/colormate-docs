Overview
--------
Colormate is a color palette management and color harmony addon for Blender. 
It aims to provide easy import and export of popular color palette exchange formats such as:

* .aco (Adobe Color Swatch)
* .acb (Adobe Color Book)
* .ase (Adobe Swatch Exchange)
* .gpl (Gimp Color Palette)
* .kpl (Krita Color Palette)
* .csv (Colormate Palette)

It also features a color harmony generator to quickly calculate color harmonies
starting from a given master color. Harmonies are calculated in four groups
**Monochrome, Complementary, Triadic and Similar**. Color calculation can be
straight mathematical or perceptive (more pleasing to the eye).
